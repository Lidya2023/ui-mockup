**Explanation for Mockup Implementation in React**
1. I used Vite + JavaScript + TailwindCSS to implement the mockup in React.
2. I found the font “Cyntho Next” by searching for the font on myfonts.com using the mockup image
3. I found the colors by using the color picker function in the chrome extension Color Zilla
4. I used a combination of flexboxes and grid boxes for the layout.
5. I used a two-column grid for the content inside the dialog box and
   used flex boxes to structure everything inside the grid cells.
6. I used the “react-drag-drop-files” npm library to implement the drag
   and drop functionality
7. The file name changes when a file is uploaded
